## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Diego Chaves**, a Web Developer from 🇨🇷 *Costa Rica* with over **10 years of experience** building scalable and maintainable applications.

Currently, I work at **Prose on Pixels** (since 2021) where I specialize in developing responsive web solutions using **Angular**, **TypeScript**, and modern front-end technologies. I also contribute to internal tools, mentor interns, and collaborate closely with designers and stakeholders to bring ideas to life.

I’m passionate about clean code, user-focused interfaces, and continuous learning. My background includes full-stack experience, UI implementation, cross-platform app development, and mentoring junior developers.
